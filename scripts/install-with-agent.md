# prx AI Agent bootstrap

Use this file when an AI Agent is setting up `prx` for a repository.

1) Install `prx` binary:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jinyongp/prx/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

2) Install the agent skill:

```bash
if command -v npx >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  npx skills add jinyongp/prx
else
  apm install jinyongp/prx
fi
```

3) Add `prx.toml` from project context:

- If `prx.toml` already exists, keep it and do not overwrite it.
- If missing, inspect the project and infer the dev port:
  - `package.json` scripts: Vite → `5173`; Next/Nuxt → `3000`; explicit script/config port wins
  - `go.mod` projects → `8080` default
  - `docker-compose.yml`/`docker-compose.yaml` with mapped host port → use that port
  - fallback: `3000`
- Create `prx.toml` using the detected service name and port:

```toml
[project]
name = "<repo-folder-name>"

[services.web]
domain = "<repo-folder-name>.example.localhost"
port = 3000
```

4) Suggest and run:

```bash
prx up
```

5) Report where the install landed and what was detected.

6) When removing agent setup, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jinyongp/prx/main/scripts/uninstall.sh | sh
# confirm prompt first, then remove all user-level prx artifacts
# unattended
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jinyongp/prx/main/scripts/uninstall.sh | sh -s -- -y
```

This removes user-level `config`, `data`, and `state` directories plus known installer target binaries,
then tries to stop a running daemon if a pid file is found.
Only paths actually present on the current machine are removed.
System trust store entries are intentionally left behind.
