# Specification

`gate` is a local-development HTTPS reverse proxy and port registry, shipped as a
single Go binary. It maps local domains to local dev servers, keeps domain and
port reservations stable across projects, and can expose selected local routes
to other devices for testing.

> [!NOTE]
> `gate` is not a production proxy. It is designed for developer machines, local
> services, and temporary test exposure.

---

## 1. Product Boundary

### Goals

| Goal | What gate provides |
| --- | --- |
| Local HTTPS by domain | `https://app.localhost` or a custom local domain routes to a local upstream such as `127.0.0.1:4310`. |
| Stable port assignment | A machine-wide registry reserves ports so projects do not hard-code or guess ports. |
| Project-local config | `gate.toml` is the shareable source of truth for a repository's local routes. |
| Standalone mappings | A developer can reserve a domain and port without a project file. |
| Daemon hot reload | A resident proxy can receive new routes without restarting. |
| Script/agent compatibility | Commands keep stdout data separate from stderr diagnostics; JSON output is stable and parseable. |
| Temporary external test access | LAN, Cloudflared, and Tailscale providers can expose selected local services. |

### Non-goals

| Non-goal | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Production traffic | gate terminates local dev traffic and assumes a developer-controlled machine. |
| Hosted environments | gate is not a server deployment platform. |
| Owning dev server processes | gate can run a child command with `PORT` injected, but it does not manage arbitrary service lifecycles as a process supervisor. |
| Replacing DNS infrastructure | gate only handles local `.localhost`, local hosts-file reflection, and provider-specific exposure workflows. |
| Default public exposure | Any route reachable outside loopback must be explicitly exposed. |

```

The CLI computes desired state from project config and the registry. Daemons are
scoped: project daemons serve one project, and the global daemon serves
standalone reservations. If the relevant daemon is running, the CLI pushes that
scope's active route table through its admin socket. If the daemon is not
running, route reservations still persist and can be loaded later.

---

## 3. Core Concepts

### Project

A project is a repository with a `gate.toml` file. `gate` discovers the file by
walking upward from the current directory until it finds `gate.toml`, a `.git`
root, the user's home directory, or the filesystem root.

```toml
[project]
name = "myapp"

[services.web]
domain = "app.localhost"

[services.api]
domain = "api.localhost"
port = 3001
```

### Service

A service maps one domain to one upstream port. If a service does not specify a
port, gate allocates one from the default pool and stores the reservation.

### Reservation

A reservation is the persisted binding of `project/service -> domain -> port`.
It survives dev server restarts.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Reserved: gate up / gate add
    Reserved --> Active: route loaded
    Active --> Reserved: gate down
    Reserved --> Removed: gate rm
    Reserved --> Removed: gate prune when owning gate.toml is gone
```

### Active Route

An active route is a reservation currently loaded into the proxy. The `Active`
flag controls whether it is included in the daemon route table. `gate down`
deactivates project routes but preserves reservations.

### Liveness

Liveness is not persisted. gate checks whether a dev server is listening by
dialing the reserved upstream. A reserved service can be `down` when no process
is listening.

---

## 4. Project Configuration

`gate.toml` is intentionally small. The common case is a project name plus one
or more service domains. Environment-backed values are available for projects
that need per-developer domains or ports, but they are not required for ordinary
local routing.

### Project Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | required | Stable project key used in registry ownership such as `myapp/web`. |
| `env_files` | string array | empty | Dotenv files used only for environment interpolation in service fields. |

`env_files` entries are resolved relative to `gate.toml`. Missing files are
ignored. Process environment values win over dotenv values, and earlier dotenv
files win over later ones.

### Service Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `domain` | string | required | Hostname gate routes. Canonicalized as lowercase without trailing dot. |
| `port` | integer or env string | auto-allocate | Local upstream port. `0` or omitted means allocate from the default pool. |
| `tls` | `internal` or `acme` | `internal` | Certificate provider for the domain. |
| `acme_dns` | string | required for `acme` | DNS-01 provider key. |

`domain` and `port` can include environment references through `${NAME}` or
`${NAME:-fallback}`. `${NAME}` is required and fails if unset. `${NAME:-fallback}`
uses the fallback when the variable is unset or empty.

```toml
[project]
name = "myapp"
env_files = [".env.local", ".env"]

[services.web]
domain = "${WEB_DOMAIN:-app.localhost}"
port = "${WEB_PORT:-3000}"
```

---

## 5. Storage Layout

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    project["Project repo"]
    gatetoml["gate.toml<br/>user-owned"]
    cfgdir["Config dir<br/>~/.config/gate"]
    registry["registry.json<br/>tool-owned"]
    sockets["daemons/*.sock<br/>scoped admin sockets"]
    datadir["Data dir<br/>~/.local/share/gate"]
    ca["root CA and cert cache"]
    statedir["State dir<br/>logs and runtime state"]
    logs["runtime logs<br/>access logs"]

    project --> gatetoml
    cfgdir --> registry
    cfgdir --> sockets
    datadir --> ca
    statedir --> logs
```

| Data | Owner | Format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gate.toml` | user and CLI | TOML | Shareable project config. Edited surgically so comments and surrounding formatting survive. |
| `registry.json` | gate only | JSON | Machine-wide reservations. Uses schema versioning, advisory file locking, and atomic write by temp file + rename. |
| Admin sockets | daemon | Unix sockets | CLI talks to scoped daemons over a local HTTP API. |
| CA material | gate | PEM files | Root key is private local state and must not be copied. Export only the root certificate. |
| Logs | gate / OS service manager | text or JSONL | Runtime and access logs are separate from command data output. |

Registry schema:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "services": {
    "myapp/web": {
      "project": "myapp",
      "service": "web",
      "domain": "app.localhost",
      "port": 4310,
      "tls": "internal",
      "dns": "localhost",
      "active": true,
      "config_path": "/repo/gate.toml"
    },
    "/standalone.localhost": {
      "service": "standalone.localhost",
      "domain": "standalone.localhost",
      "port": 4301,
      "tls": "internal",
      "standalone": true,
      "active": true
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 6. Port Management

The default allocation pool is owned by `internal/port`. When a service omits
`port`, gate chooses an available port that is not already reserved and is not
currently bound by the OS.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    start["service needs port"]
    fixed{"port set in gate.toml?"}
    existing{"existing reservation?"}
    used["build used-port set<br/>registry + OS probes"]
    allocate["allocate from pool"]
    reserve["write reservation"]

    start --> fixed
    fixed -->|"yes"| reserve
    fixed -->|"no"| existing
    existing -->|"yes"| reserve
    existing -->|"no"| used
    used --> allocate
    allocate --> reserve
```

Rules:

- Domains are globally unique on the machine.
- Reserved ports are globally unique on the machine when non-zero.
- Existing reservations keep their ports unless config changes.
- Fixed ports from `gate.toml` win over automatic allocation.
- Port reservation is best-effort; the OS can still let another process bind a
  reserved port while the dev server is down.

---

## 7. DNS Modes

| Mode | When used | Permission | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `localhost` | Domains ending in `.localhost` | none | No file changes. Modern resolvers map `.localhost` to loopback. |
| `hosts` | Custom local domains | sudo may be required | gate writes only its managed block in `/etc/hosts`. |

Mode is selected from the domain or forced with `--dns localhost|hosts`.

```text
# gate managed block
127.0.0.1  app.example.test
127.0.0.1  api.example.test
```

Hosts-file editing is guarded by ownership and symlink checks. Permission
failures return exit code `3`.

---

## 8. TLS

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    hello["TLS ClientHello<br/>SNI = app.localhost"]
    provider{"tls provider"}
    internal["internal CA<br/>issue or load leaf cert"]
    acme["ACME DNS-01<br/>issue public cert"]
    cache["certificate cache"]
    handshake["complete TLS handshake"]

    hello --> provider
    provider -->|"internal"| internal
    provider -->|"acme"| acme
    internal --> cache
    acme --> cache
    cache --> handshake
```

### Internal CA

The default provider creates a local root CA and issues leaf certificates for
local domains. Run `gate trust` once to install the root certificate into OS and
browser trust stores.

For another device, export the root certificate:

```bash
gate ca export --out gate-root.crt
```

Never copy or share the root private key.

### ACME

The `acme` provider is for domains the developer actually controls. It uses
DNS-01 so local inbound ports are not required. `acme_dns` identifies the DNS
provider integration.

```toml
[services.api]
domain = "api.dev.example.com"
tls = "acme"
acme_dns = "cloudflare"
```

---

## 9. Proxy Behavior

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant P as gate HTTPS handler
    participant R as Route table
    participant U as Upstream dev server

    C->>P: GET https://app.localhost/path
    P->>R: lookup host
    alt no route
        P-->>C: 404
    else non-loopback and not exposed
        P-->>C: 403
    else auth required and invalid
        P-->>C: 401
    else route exists
        P->>U: reverse proxy to http://127.0.0.1:PORT
        alt upstream down
            P-->>C: 502 with local-service message
        else upstream responds
            U-->>P: response / stream / websocket
            P-->>C: proxied response
        end
    end
```

Implementation notes:

- Route lookup is by canonical host, excluding any request port.
- Route table reload uses `atomic.Pointer`; new requests see the new table,
  in-flight requests keep their current route.
- HTTP requests on the plaintext listener redirect to HTTPS.
- The reverse proxy preserves streaming behavior with immediate flushing.
- WebSocket, SSE, HMR, and HTTP/2 are treated as ordinary reverse-proxy traffic.
- Non-loopback clients are blocked unless the route has been explicitly exposed.
- Optional per-route basic auth is enforced before proxying.

---

## 10. Daemon and Admin Socket

Each daemon owns one pair of front proxy listeners. The CLI controls each daemon
over a scoped Unix-domain socket.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    cli["gate up -d"]
    store["update registry"]
    dns["ensure DNS"]
    scope["resolve scope<br/>project:name or global"]
    start{"scoped daemon running?"}
    launch["start scoped daemon"]
    push["PUT scoped /routes"]
    active["new route table active"]

    cli --> store --> dns --> scope --> start
    start -->|"no and --daemon/-d"| launch --> push
    start -->|"yes"| push
    start -->|"no and no -d"| note["print note: no daemon running"]
    push --> active
```

Admin API:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/status` | Return daemon PID, route count, uptime, and listen addresses. |
| `PUT` | `/routes` | Replace the active route table. |
| `POST` | `/reload` | Reserved reload endpoint; currently reports reload success. |

Only one daemon can own a given HTTPS/HTTP listen address pair. Different
project daemons can run at the same time when their listen addresses do not
conflict. `gate up -d` checks only the current project daemon; a different
daemon conflicts only when the new process cannot bind the requested address.

---

## 11. Command Surface

| --- | --- | --- |
| `gate init [-y] [--name name] [--force]` | Scaffold a starter `gate.toml`. | text / json |

Exit codes:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | success |
| `1` | general error |
| `2` | usage error |
| `3` | permission required |
| `4` | port, domain, or daemon-listen conflict |

---

## 12. Output Contract

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    cmd["command result"]
    json{"--json?"}
    tty{"stdout is TTY<br/>and NO_COLOR unset?"}
    data["stdout: single json object/array"]
    rich["stdout: styled text output"]
    plain["stdout: plain text output"]
    diag["stderr: diagnostics, warnings, logs"]

    cmd --> json
    json -->|"yes"| data
    json -->|"no"| tty
    tty -->|"yes"| rich
    tty -->|"no"| plain
    cmd --> diag
```

Rules:

- Program data goes to stdout.
- Diagnostics, warnings, progress, and logs go to stderr.
- `--json` emits one JSON value and no extra text on stdout.
- JSON-mode errors are written to stderr as a JSON error envelope.
- Rich output is enabled only when stdout is a terminal and `NO_COLOR` is unset.
- Piped output stays plain and grep-friendly.

The current presentation layer uses `lipgloss` for TTY-only styling and
borderless tables. There is no fullscreen TUI command in the current public
surface. Any future interactive TUI must keep the same output contract and must
not affect non-TTY or JSON behavior.

---

## 13. Exposure Providers

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    route["project service route"]
    local["local<br/>print local HTTPS URL"]
    lan["lan<br/>same network, .local only"]
    cf["cloudflared<br/>temporary public URL"]
    ts["tailscale<br/>tailnet access"]

    route --> local
    route --> lan
    route --> cf
    route --> ts
```

| Provider | Scope | Requirements | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `local` | Same machine | active route | No external exposure. |
| `lan` | Same network | `.local` domain, reachable machine, trusted CA on clients | gate validates and marks the route exposed; it does not configure other devices' DNS. |
| `cloudflared` | Public temporary URL | `cloudflared` in `PATH` | Prefer `--auth user:pass`; quick tunnel URL is temporary. |
| `tailscale` | Tailnet | logged-in `tailscale` in `PATH` | Uses Tailscale Serve; detailed teardown is handled with Tailscale commands. |

`gate expose` currently targets project services, not standalone domains.

Security rule: exposing a route is the only way non-loopback clients can pass
the proxy's loopback guard.

---

## 14. Security Model

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    user["User shell"]
    gate["gate CLI"]
    privileged{"privileged operation?"}
    normal["normal user operation"]
    sudo["OS approval / sudo path"]
    hosts["/etc/hosts managed block"]
    trust["OS/browser trust store"]
    key["local root CA key<br/>0600 under private data dir"]

    user --> gate
    gate --> privileged
    privileged -->|"no"| normal
    privileged -->|"yes"| sudo
    sudo --> hosts
    sudo --> trust
    gate --> key
```

Privileged operations:

| Operation | Why permission can be needed | Guardrail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trusting root CA | OS/browser trust stores are protected | Trust-store integration is isolated behind seams and uses OS-native mechanisms. |
| Editing `/etc/hosts` | System file | gate edits only its managed block and validates target ownership/symlink state. |
| Binding low ports | `:443` and `:80` can require privileges on some systems | Daemon/service manager owns the listener process. |

Other security properties:

- Root CA private key is local private state.
- Export command writes only the public root certificate.
- Non-loopback clients are blocked unless a route is explicitly exposed.
- Basic auth uses constant-time comparison when configured on an exposed route.
- `internal/truststore` is a vendored, self-contained library and must not import
  gate packages.

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `cmd/gate` | Entrypoint, cobra root command, subcommand dispatch, top-level usage. |
| `internal/cli` | Command parsing, command orchestration, text/json output, exit codes. |
| `internal/ui` | TTY-only styling helpers. Presentation tier only. |
| `internal/paths` | XDG/macOS config, data, state, and runtime path resolution. |
| `internal/config` | `gate.toml` discovery, parsing, validation, env interpolation, surgical editing. |
| `internal/registry` | Registry schema, conflict checks, file locking, atomic persistence. |
| `internal/port` | Port allocation, liveness checks, `PORT` env injection, child process run behavior. |
| `internal/dns` | DNS mode selection, `.localhost` no-op, hosts-file provider. |
| `internal/ca` | Root CA creation, leaf issuance, trust/export commands. |
| `internal/truststore` | Vendored trust-store implementation. Self-contained, no gate imports. |
| `internal/tlsprov` | TLS provider abstraction, internal CA provider, ACME/DNS-01 flow. |
| `internal/proxy` | Host-routing reverse proxy, TLS termination hooks, route hot reload. |
| `internal/daemon` | Resident process, admin socket API, lifecycle status. |
| `internal/expose` | Local/LAN/Cloudflared/Tailscale exposure providers and auth handling. |
| `internal/logx` | Runtime logging, access logs, rotation. |

Dependency policy:

| Tier | Allowed dependency shape |
| --- | --- |
| Core data plane and security packages | Prefer stdlib and `golang.org/x`; avoid presentation dependencies. |
| Presentation and CLI packages | May use small, targeted libraries such as `cobra`, `go-toml`, and `lipgloss`. |
| Vendored trust-store code | Must stay self-contained and receive gate-specific behavior through generic seams. |

---

## 16. Development Gates

The project command runner is `just`.

| Recipe | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `just build` | Build `bin/gate`. |
| `just test` | Run `go test -race ./...`. |
| `just lint-json` | Emit structured lint diagnostics on stdout and text diagnostics on stderr. |
| `just lint` | Run text lint output. |
| `just vuln` | Run `govulncheck ./...`. |
| `just check` | Run tests, lint, and vulnerability scan. Must pass before PR. |
| `just fmt` | Run gofmt and goimports. |

Validation priorities:

- Output contract tests for plain, TTY-gated, `NO_COLOR`, and JSON paths.
- Registry concurrency and atomic-write tests.
- Proxy tests for routing, hot reload, loopback guard, auth, 502 classification,
  streaming, and redirects.
- Trust/hosts privileged paths tested through fakes rather than mutating the
  developer or CI machine.
- `internal/truststore` domain separation: no imports from `gate/internal/...`.

---

## 17. Current TUI Scope

The previous TUI documents were planning artifacts. The current implemented
scope is intentionally smaller and is now part of this spec:

| Area | Current state |
| --- | --- |
| Rich CLI usage | Implemented for TTY output through `internal/ui`. |
| Rich tables/status | Implemented as TTY-only presentation sugar. |
| JSON and pipe output | Plain and stable; rich rendering is disabled. |
| Fullscreen dashboard | Not part of the current command surface. |
| Interactive pickers | Not part of the current command surface. |
| Charts/metrics TUI | Not part of the current command surface. |

If fullscreen or interactive TUI features are added later, they must be specified
in this file before implementation and must preserve the output contract in
section 12.
